/*You are conductor of a bus .There are n chairs and n passengers in the bus. You are given an array chairs of length n, where chairs[i] is the position of the ith chair. You are also given the array passengers of length n, where passengers[j] is the position of the jth passenger.
You may perform the following move any number of times:
Increase or decrease the position of the ith passenger by 1 (i.e., moving the ith passenger from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each passenger to a chair such that no two passengers are in the same chair and every passenger gets a chair.
Note that there may be multiple chairs or passengers in the same position at the beginning.*/
